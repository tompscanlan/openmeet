# OpenMeet: Distributed Open-Source Event Platform

## Description
OpenMeet is an open-source, self-hostable event platform that creates a distributed network for organizing and discovering local events and interest groups. Users can run their own instances, which sync with other instances to form a larger network.

## Importance
This approach promotes data ownership, privacy, and community control while still allowing for a wide-reaching network effect. It provides an alternative to centralized platforms without the complexities of blockchain technology.

## Demand
There's growing interest in decentralized and self-hosted alternatives to big tech platforms. The success of platforms like Mastodon demonstrates a market for distributed social technologies. The events industry remains substantial, indicating potential for adoption.

## Technical Feasibility
This could be implemented as a server application written in a language like Rust, Go, or Node.js for efficiency and ease of deployment. It would use CouchDB for data replication between instances. A REST API would allow for custom frontends, with a default web interface provided.

Key components:
1. Server application for hosting events and user data
2. CouchDB instances for syncing between nodes
3. Federation protocol for instance communication
4. Web interface for users to interact with the platform

## Considerations
- Ensuring data consistency across instances while allowing for offline operation and conflict resolution.
- Implementing effective discovery mechanisms for events across the network.
- Balancing between instance autonomy and network-wide policies (e.g., for moderation).
- Developing a sustainable model for maintaining and updating the open-source codebase.

## Potential Advantages
- Users and communities can have full control over their data by running their own instances.
- Resilience against central point of failure or control.
- Potential for customization and extension by the community.
- Lower overall costs distributed among instance operators.

## Potential Challenges
- Achieving critical mass of users and instance operators.
- Ensuring ease of use for non-technical users who can't run their own instances.
- Handling search and discovery across a distributed network efficiently.
- Implementing effective spam prevention and moderation in a distributed system.

## Key Focus Areas
1. Designing an efficient and robust federation protocol
2. Creating a user-friendly interface for both event organizers and attendees
3. Developing tools to make instance setup and maintenance as simple as possible
4. Building features that incentivize users to run and maintain their own instances
