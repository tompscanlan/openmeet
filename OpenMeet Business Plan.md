# OpenMeet Business Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

OpenMeet is an open-source distributed group event platform designed to provide communities with alternatives to existing solutions. We aim to create a public utility for community building tools that will revolutionize how people organize and discover local events and interest groups. Our platform offers a unique approach by allowing users to run their own instances, which can sync with others to form a larger network, promoting data ownership, privacy, and community control. The business will also operate a public instance at openmeet.net, which users can connect to if they don't have a local instance and choose not to run one.

Key features:
- Self-hostable, open-source platform for getting communities together
- Distributed network for event organization and discovery
- Public instance available for users who prefer not to self-host
- Emphasis on data ownership and privacy

OpenMeet addresses critical issues in the current event platform market, such as high costs and data control concerns. By offering a free public service and the option for self-hosting, we aim to enable modern communites.

Our target market includes privacy-conscious individuals, community organizers, institutions looking to facilitate community building, and users of existing platforms that aren't meeting their needs. OpenMeet is positioned to provide something that could challenge centralized social platforms, which are catering to profits over people.

The business model combines open-source development with potential revenue streams from premium features, support on institutional instances, and hosting solutions for smaller institutions. This approach allows us to maintain the platform's core values while ensuring sustainable growth and development.

## 3. Market Analysis

### Target Market

OpenMeet's target market is broad and inclusive, encompassing individuals aged 13 and up of all genders who are seeking companionship and community connections. Our platform caters to everyone who wants to:

- Find like-minded individuals
- Participate in local events and activities
- Build meaningful relationships
- Discover new interests and hobbies
- Connect with their community

By focusing on the universal human need for companionship, OpenMeet has the potential to appeal to a wide range of users across different age groups, backgrounds, and interests.

### Industry Trends

The events and social networking industry has seen significant growth in recent years, with a particular emphasis on digital platforms that facilitate real-world connections. The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated the need for innovative solutions that bring people together, both virtually and in-person.

### Competitor Analysis

OpenMeet's main competitors in the event organization and community-building space include:

1. Meetup.com: A well-established platform for organizing local events and interest groups. Meetup has a ghost town problem where groups are populated with people who are no longer active. It's difficult to trust the groups to be active.  Meetup.com has a $30 fee for setting up events, which prices many people out from being able to participate in building community.  Meetup.com has resurrected groups who's owners had left and ran them as puppets, challenging ownership of the group and contained created content.
2. Facebook Groups: Leverages the vast user base of Facebook to create community spaces.  You are the product.  You data is sold, and you are shown ads.  There can be a toxic element to these groups.
3. Eventbrite: Primarily focused on event ticketing and discovery.  If you want to charge people to attend an event, this is great. If you want to build a community, this is not so great.

While these competitors have significant market share, OpenMeet differentiates itself through:

- distributed architecture avoids having a centralized service provider generating money off your engagement
- Enhanced data privacy and user control 
- Community-driven development
- serving communities, not serving users up to advertisers

By addressing the growing concerns around data ownership and privacy, OpenMeet is positioned to capture users who are looking for alternatives to centralized platforms.

## 4. Product and Services
## 4. Product Description

OpenMeet is an innovative, open-source platform designed to facilitate meaningful connections and community building. It consists of two main components:

1. The OpenMeet software: A distributed, open-source application that can be self-hosted by communities or organizations.
2. OpenMeet.net: A global public instance hosted at openmeet.net, providing immediate access to the platform for users worldwide.

### Key Features

1. **Distributed Architecture**: OpenMeet's decentralized design ensures data privacy and gives communities control over their information.

2. **Open-Source**: The platform's code is publicly available, promoting transparency and allowing for community-driven development and customization. Most importantly, no central authority means OpenMeet as an entity can cease to be, and the communities don't have to cease running the platform.

3. **QR Code Invitations**: A unique feature allowing users to invite new people to their instance's groups, or events in person using QR codes, balancing ease of connection with privacy protection.

4. **Privacy-Focused Introductions**: Users can connect with new people without immediately revealing extensive personal information, fostering a safe environment for building relationships.

5. **Event Organization**: Tools for creating, managing, and discovering local events and activities.

6. **Interest-Based Groups**: Ability to form and join groups based on shared interests, hobbies, or goals.

7. **Flexible Hosting Options**: Communities can choose to self-host their own instance or use the global public instance at OpenMeet.net.

8. **Impromptu Events**: Tools for creating and discovering events that happen right now.

### How It Works

1. User Alice can access OpenMeet through OpenMeet.net. There she can find nearby people and events that are public.
2. User Bob can access OpenMeet through a self-hosted or community hosted instance by going to a URL that entity controls, like AnotherMeet.net.
3. Alice and Bob create profiles with as much or as little information as they're comfortable sharing. Other users see a limited version of that profile based on the privacy settings the user selects.
4. Alice and Bob can not find each other, as they are on seperate instances.
5. Bob can invite Alice to an event on his instance.
6. Alice, with the invitation, can create an account and login to Bob's instance.
7. Now Bob can find Alice on his instance, and they can interact there.
8. Now when Alice looks at her event feed, it is coming from both instances, but she is not doing extra work to make that happen.
4. When meeting new people in person, Alice can share a QR code that provides a limited introduction and invitation to connect on the platform.

OpenMeet's unique approach to privacy, open-source nature, and innovative features set it apart in the social networking and event organization space. By prioritizing user control and data privacy, OpenMeet aims to create a more trustworthy and community-driven alternative to existing centralized socialplatforms.

# OpenMeet: Distributed Open-Source Event Platform

## Description
OpenMeet is an open-source, self-hostable event platform that creates a distributed network for organizing and discovering local events and interest groups. Users can run their own instances, which may sync with other instances to form a larger network.  OpenMeet hosts a public instance, and users may connect with that if they do not want to run their own instance. If you want total ownership of your data, you'll need tojoin a community that is running their own instance. Joinging a community should be free, though large groups may charge dues to cover the cost of hosting.

## Importance
This approach promotes data ownership, privacy, and community control while still allowing for a wide-reaching network effect. It provides an alternative to centralized platforms without the complexities of blockchain technology.  The goal of a free public service opens the community to those that are left out of a system which requires $30 per month.

## Demand
There's growing interest in decentralized and self-hosted alternatives to big tech platforms.
Privacy concerns abound.  There are  
The success of platforms like Mastodon demonstrates a market for distributed social technologies.
The events industry remains substantial, indicating potential for adoption.

## Technical Feasibility
This could be implemented as a server application written in a language like Rust, Go, or Node.js for efficiency and ease of deployment. It would use Cassandra for data replication between instances. A REST API would allow for custom frontends, with a default web interface provided.

Key components:
1. Server application for hosting events and user data
2. Cassandra instances for syncing between nodes
3. Federation protocol for instance communication
4. Web interface for users to interact with the platform

## Considerations
- Federation: Ensuring data consistency across instances while allowing for offline operation and conflict resolution.
- Implementing effective discovery mechanisms for events across the platform
- Balancing between instance autonomy and network-wide policies (e.g., for moderation). How do we make sure trolls aren't a problem, or spam tactics? Do we build that into the tool, or is that an add on worth selling to institutions?
- Developing a sustainable model for maintaining and updating the open-source codebase.

## Potential Advantages
- Users and communities can have full control over their data by running their own instances.
- Resilience against central point of failure or control.
- Potential for customization and extension by the community.
- Lower overall costs distributed among instance operators.

## Potential Challenges
- Achieving critical mass of users and instance operators.
- Ensuring ease of use for non-technical users who can't run their own instances.
- Handling search and discovery across a distributed network efficiently.
- Implementing effective spam prevention and moderation in a distributed system.

## Key Focus Areas
1. Designing an efficient and robust federation protocol
2. Creating a user-friendly interface for both event organizers and attendees
3. Developing tools to make instance setup and maintenance as simple as possible
4. Building features that incentivize users to run and maintain their own instances

## Problems with existing solutions:
* groups are ghost towns. people don't show up to events.
* $30 per month to host a group keeps the young, who have no money, the old who have limited funds, and the poor who have no funds, away from the table.
* existing platforms don't do a good job of helping people find events.
* regular events in a group form an in-group that keeps new people out.
* "they took my abandoned event and ran it as their own, because I didn't take my data with me when I left."
* support is anything but
* RSVP no-shows
* Meetup currently runs on three different interfaces that interact with each other with sometimes chaotic results.
* Groups focused on selling something
* Social acceptance of meeting strangers
* physical safety concerns
* harassment
* Many people want more spontanious events, "I'm running to the park for an hour, anyone want come hang out right now?"
* "it feels like Meetup works best for medium sized lecture-style groups and is less useful for small, unstructured groups."
* "It’s mostly geeks and the unpopular kids all getting together." Acceptance and inclusivity is a problem.
